This document outlines the "Blockchain Apps" initiative from OOIT.com, focused on exploring practical uses of blockchain technology.

**What We're Doing**

We're researching and developing applications that leverage blockchain for various purposes, including:

* **Improved Data Management:**  Securely storing, retrieving, and managing data on blockchains. This includes exploring solutions for handling large datasets efficiently.
* **Enhanced Security:**  Developing robust methods for account management, role-based access control, and private key security.
* **Increased Efficiency:** Optimizing transaction speeds and minimizing costs associated with blockchain operations.

**Our Projects**

We've built several proof-of-concept apps to demonstrate the potential of blockchain:

* **Universal Naming Service:** A decentralized way to manage names and properties for accounts and contracts.
* **My Secret Store:** Securely store sensitive information on the blockchain.
* **Artwork Proof:**  Verify the authenticity and timestamp of digital artwork.
* **Secure Blockchain Table (SBT):** A highly secure, collaborative data storage solution similar to Excel, built on blockchain.
* **Address Book:**  A decentralized address book that can be used globally, within a company, or personally.
* **Document Store:**  Securely store and share documents with encryption and QR code functionality.
* **Pure Blockchain Website:**  Exploring the creation of websites hosted entirely on a blockchain.
* **Medical Record:**  Allow users to securely store and share medical records with healthcare providers via QR codes.
* **Payable Messages/Ads:**  Reward users for reading and interacting with messages and advertisements.
* **Meeting Support:**  Facilitate secure and confidential meetings with document sharing and agenda management.
* **Invitation Support:**  A blockchain-based invitation system with built-in incentives.
* **Simple Card Game:**  A demonstration of using blockchain for online gaming with cryptocurrency or tokens.

**Future Goals**

We're actively working on:

* **Integrating price sources for crypto values.**
* **Utilizing Solidity events for enhanced functionality.**
* **Implementing fail-over mechanisms with backup providers.**
* **Exploring cryptographic libraries (like NaCl) for advanced security.**
* **Researching and implementing zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving applications.**
* **Improving DevOps support for blockchain applications, including contract deployment, management, key management, and user authentication.**

This documentation also provides resources for developers, including a bookstore, information on EVM and databases, handling big numbers, solutions for lost keys, and explanations of network and chain IDs.
