# Proof of Concepts Roadmap

## Reviewing Openzeppelin Contracts

## Understanding and Implementing Web2, Web3 and Blockchain

#### Creation of a Shared Secret Contract

- Establish a contract that preserves a solitary, encrypted secret, accessible only to certain participants (identified by their addresses).
- Allow the contract owner to modify the list of users, i.e., add or remove users.
- This secret can subsequently be employed to encrypt data meant for a specific group of users.
- The contracts will be stored within the contract registry.

#### Crafting a Contract Requiring Users' Consent for Accessing the Secret

- Create a contract that houses a single secret that can only be revealed if a predetermined list of users (identified by their addresses) provide their consent via votes. This secret is then made accessible solely to these users.

## Building a 100% Blockchain-Powered Website

What are the advantages?

- Independence from any single vendor and no cost of hosting post deployment.
- Immunity from destruction, thus, providing excellent durability.
- Fulfils archiving requirements and maintain revisions effectively to a large extent (100%).
