# What is the difference between Network Id and Chain Id?

In the context of Ethereum, the `chain ID` and the `network ID` serve different purposes, especially considering Ethereum’s transition towards ETH 2.0 and the introduction of Ethereum Improvement Proposal (EIP)-155.

### Network ID
The `network ID` is an identifier for distinguishing between different Ethereum networks while the client is connecting to peers. For example:

- Mainnet has a network ID of `1`.
- Ropsten, a commonly used testnet, has a network ID of `3`.

Different Ethereum networks need different network IDs to prevent nodes from different networks connecting to each other.

### Chain ID
`Chain ID`, introduced with EIP-155, serves a different purpose—it is used for transaction signing to distinguish between different chains and prevent replay attacks. A replay attack is where transactions broadcast on one Ethereum network are re-broadcasted on a different network. This was possible because, before EIP-155, transactions were signed without reference to the chain they were on, so a transaction signed on one chain was valid on every other chain with the same network ID.

### Examples
Here are the network and chain IDs for some networks:
- Ethereum Mainnet: Network ID `1`, Chain ID `1`.
- Ropsten Testnet: Network ID `3`, Chain ID `3`.

### Specifying Both IDs
When you are configuring network settings, particularly when connecting to custom networks or testnets, you may need to specify both the network ID and the chain ID.

For example, in a Truffle configuration file, specifying a network might look something like this:

```javascript
module.exports = {
  networks: {
    development: {
      host: "127.0.0.1",
      port: 8545,
      network_id: "5777", // Network ID for Ganache
      chainId: 5777 // Explicitly specifying chain ID for Ganache
    }
  }
};
```

### Conclusion
In summary, while both `network ID` and `chain ID` are numerical identifiers used to distinguish between different Ethereum networks, they serve different purposes. The `network ID` is used during the peer connection process to ensure nodes are on the same network, while the `chain ID` is used as part of the transaction signature to prevent replay attacks across different networks and chains.


## Can you give me an example where the Chain Id is different from the network id?
