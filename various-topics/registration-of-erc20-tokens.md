## Registration of ERC-20 Tokens
Registering an icon (also known as a token logo or image) for an ERC-20 token so that it appears on platforms like
Etherscan, MetaMask, and CoinMarketCap involves a few different steps, as each platform has its own process for
accepting and displaying token logos. Here's a general guide for each:

### 1. Etherscan

To add a token logo on Etherscan:

1. **Verify Contract**: Ensure that your token’s smart contract is verified on Etherscan. This means the source code is
   published and visible on Etherscan.

2. **Token Update Request**: Go to the page of your token on Etherscan. Click on “Update Token Information” link (
   usually found below the token tracker name).

3. **Provide Information**: Fill in the required details, including the token logo. The logo should typically be in PNG
   format with a transparent background and a recommended size (often 256x256 pixels).

4. **Submit and Wait**: After submission, wait for Etherscan’s team to review and approve your request. This process can
   take some time.

### 2. MetaMask

MetaMask pulls token information from various sources, including the contract itself and other token information
repositories. To have your icon visible in MetaMask:

1. **Ensure Etherscan Accuracy**: Make sure your token’s information is up-to-date and accurate on Etherscan, as
   MetaMask may use data from there.

2. **Contribute to MetaMask Repository**: MetaMask maintains a token repository on GitHub. You can add your token's logo
   by submitting it to the [MetaMask/contract-metadata](https://github.com/MetaMask/contract-metadata) repository.
   Follow the guidelines provided in the repository for adding token logos.

3. **Pull Request**: You’ll need to fork the repository, add your token logo (in the correct format and size), and
   submit a pull request for review.

### 3. CoinMarketCap

To list your token on CoinMarketCap and add a logo:

1. **Apply for Listing**: If your token is not already listed on CoinMarketCap, you need to apply for it. Use
   the [CoinMarketCap request form](https://coinmarketcap.com/request/) for new tokens.

2. **Provide Accurate Data**: Ensure you provide all necessary information, including the token's contract address,
   details, and logo.

3. **Wait for Approval**: CoinMarketCap team will review your application. This process might take some time, depending
   on various factors like the token’s trading volume, community interest, and exchange listings.

### General Advice:

- **Follow Guidelines**: Each platform has specific requirements for image format, size, and other details. Make sure to
  follow these guidelines closely.
- **Be Patient**: Approval processes can vary in time. It’s important to be patient after submitting your requests.
- **Keep Information Consistent**: Ensure that your token information is consistent across different platforms.
  Discrepancies can lead to delays or rejections.

Remember, getting your token recognized and having its logo displayed on these platforms is just one aspect of token
management. Ensuring that your token has a solid use case, transparent operations, and active community support is
crucial for long-term success.
