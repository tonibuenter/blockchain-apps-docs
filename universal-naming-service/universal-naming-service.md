# Universal Naming Service (UNS)

The Universal Naming Service (UNS) is a smart contract deployed on a blockchain that allows users to register unique
names:

- **Register Addresses**R: Associate your own address or a contract address with a unique name using a restricted
  character set.
- **Registration Fee**R: Pay a small fee (around 1 USD) to register a name.
- **Attach Metadata**R: Add custom key-value pairs to your registered name (additional fees may apply).
- **Unregister**R: Remove your own address or a contract address you own from the UNS.
- **Transfer Ownership**R: Transfer a registered name to another address.

### Key Points:

- The **UNS** provides a human-readable way to interact with blockchain addresses and contracts.
- Names are unique within the **UNS**, preventing duplicates.
- Users can add additional information to their registered names using metadata (key/value pairs).
- The **UNS** is a fully decentralized service, meaning it's not controlled by any single entity.
