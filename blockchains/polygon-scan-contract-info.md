While deploying a smart contract on the Polygon (Matic) blockchain creates the contract on the network, it doesn't automatically make its details like source code and ABI readily available on PolygonScan. Here's what you need to do to set up this information:

**1. Verification Process:**

PolygonScan offers a verification process where you can submit your contract's source code and ABI for public viewing. This enhances transparency and allows users to understand the contract's functionality.

Here's the general process:

* **Navigate to PolygonScan:** Visit [https://polygonscan.com/](https://polygonscan.com/).
* **Go to the Verification section:** Click on "Verify Contract" under the "Tools" section.
* **Provide contract details:** Enter your contract address, compiler type (e.g., Solidity), and optimization used (if any).
* **Upload source code:** Paste your contract's source code into the provided field.
* **Verify and publish:** After confirming the details, click on "Verify and Publish."

**2. Additional Tips:**

* **Ensure code compatibility:** Make sure the uploaded code matches the exact code deployed on the blockchain for successful verification.
* **Optional code optimization:** If you optimized the code during compilation, select the "Yes" option for code optimization during verification.
* **Consider using verification tools:** Various online tools and frameworks like Remix and Hardhat can streamline the verification process. They can compile and optimize your code and often offer one-click deployment and verification options.

**Remember:** 

* Verifying your contract is optional but highly recommended for transparency and user trust.
* Only share the source code and ABI publicly if you're comfortable doing so. Sensitive information within the code might not be suitable for public viewing.
