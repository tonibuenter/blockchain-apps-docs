# Blockchain Apps Documentation

_Blockchain Apps_ is an OOIT.com initiative exploring the potential of blockchain technology.

## Key Topics

- **Development**: Building, testing, and deploying smart contracts (EVM compatible)
- **Data**: Storing, retrieving, and securing data on blockchains
- **Scaling**: Handling large datasets (e.g. with Arweave)
- **Efficiency**: Transaction costs and speed
- **Security**: Account, roles and private key management
- **Comparisons**: Understanding Blockchain vs. traditional and cloud apps

## Proof of Concept Apps

To promote the gained knowledge and suggested topics a set of POC Apps have been implemented.

- **[Universal Naming Service](universal-naming-service%2Funiversal-naming-service.md)**
- **[My Secret Store](secret-store/secret-store.md)**
- **Artwork Proof** (timestamping and authenticity)
- **[Secure Blockchain Table (SBT)](secure-blockchain-table/secure-blockchain-table.md)**: Highly secure, Excel-like
  data storage
- **Address Book** (global, company-wide, personal)
- **Document store**: User can save documents (encrypted/unencrypted) in a folder structure and create QR codes and
  links
- **Pure Blockchain Website**
- **Medical Record**: User can upload medical records (fully encrypted) and Produce a QR Code a doctor can scan and open
  for emergency.
- **Payable Messages**: Use gets money for reading and confirming mails a company/user sent him
- **Payable Adds**: Similar to the above: user can read adds and comment and gets money for that
- **Meeting Support**: Supports highly confidential meetings (with documents, agenda, resolutions)
- **Invitation Support**: User sends an invitation (per mail) to a person A with a small amount of money. If person A
  creates/uses his account he gets the amount. User can revoke the invitation any time
- **Simple Card Game** playing a card game online with small amounts of money/game token
